= Editing For Professionals =

Platform 5 was built for web professionals and their clients. It is extremely fast, bloat-free, and fun to work with. Designers do what they love, clients get the control they need.

= No Coding, No Debugging =

Coding is tedious and frustrating, even if you are great at it. That's why Platform 5 allows you to drop in sections of pre-coded design with a single-click.

= Supercharge any WP theme =

Platform 5 is a plugin that works with any standard WordPress theme. Add it to existing client sites or use it with that old framework you love.

= A few more reasons you'll love Platform 5... =


* **Mobile First**  
Platform 5 was built with mobile devices in mind. It is responsive and looks great everywhere.

* **Drag & Drop**  
Control page layouts with a simple drag and drop system that won't get in your way.

* **Fast as Hell**  
Platform 5 is rendered in the visitors browser so it runs fast even on cheap hosting.

* **Developer Friendly**  
PageLines supports all the WordPress tools you are used to. Child themes, templates, plugins, etc...

* **Extension Based**  
Platform 5 is extension oriented, which means it's as lean or powerful as you want it to be.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Platform 5, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type Platform 5 and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work just like any other WordPress plugin; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
